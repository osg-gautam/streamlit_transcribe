1915_Almanac_Psychiatrist_547_UR_ W-TDI__USA_09042020 0500PM EST.m4a,B,233,"So the issue we're having, at least with the Abilify product, the nurses complain about clogs with Ariana. Do we have any of those issues with this?",2829,2843,27,Sad,Negative,none
1915_Almanac_Psychiatrist_547_UR_ W-TDI__USA_09042020 0500PM EST.m4a,A,234,Would that be a concern?,2845,2847,5,Sad,Neutral,none
1915_Almanac_Psychiatrist_547_UR_ W-TDI__USA_09042020 0500PM EST.m4a,B,235,"Yeah. I mean, again, my nurses is kind of like hesitate with Arizona. But of course they still do it. And this has happened a lot. The needle seems to get clogged. It's not as bad with antennas. So I'm hoping this doesn't happen with Product X one. And the other thing is patients these days they want something longer, like when they come in, they're already saying I want the three month injection. So if somebody is on an Abilify product, you know, the best we can offer them is Arista for every two months. That's the longest we can do. So if down the road we can have that length option, that would be great. Just imagine 12 injections a year versus four injections a year when we sell it, when we present it that way. It sounds very tempting to go with for a year, especially when in Vega comes out with their six monthly. I don't know if it's going to last the whole time, but, you know, two inductions a year, so you can't beat that. So if we can get this longer, lasting longer, that would be great. The other thing is getting different notes. So if an antenna, you only have the 300 400. And I know some people like going to throw a little bit extra Abilify to get the lower dose. But if we can have that different dose range, like a bipolar patients don't need that high. So maybe 10 milligrams, then we have like 15 20 if we need to go up a little bit. If we can have that variety of dosage, that would be great.",2847,2945,278,Fear,Positive,none
1915_Almanac_Psychiatrist_547_UR_ W-TDI__USA_09042020 0500PM EST.m4a,A,236,"Alright, recall that I asked you to keep in mind that a six month Pala pardon formulation would be available in the market when Product X one comes out. What impact might that have on your use of Product X one?",2946,2965,41,Fear,Positive,none
1915_Almanac_Psychiatrist_547_UR_ W-TDI__USA_09042020 0500PM EST.m4a,B,237,"Well, the first thing is we have to see if it does last that whole six months. I don't know how many patients would be comfortable switching, so I think it's more like clinical. I'm sure they'll have data. They'll have data to show it works. But clinically and does it work? I mean, they said smtrend, that's going to last for three months. It doesn't. Some patients the Abilify maintain doesn't last that 28 days. It doesn't. So I had to do like a weird 26 day injection for mainten. So again, it's all based on what we see clinically. So I think six months is kind of like way out there for now. So I'm not worried about the six month duration competing with something that's one a month. But again, like I said, if we have those options to at least stretch it like two or 3 months, that would make it more palatable for us and the patients. But I mean, I don't think having and not everybody is suitable for in Vegas, especially when their prolactin starts to go down or go up. Sorry. I mean, you have to switch them to an area proposal product. I'm not too worried that it would compete. It's a totally different patient population that you're looking at. Okay, so any other thoughts or comments about anything we've talked about more options always better in Jackson size. Again, how do we see that the whole medication has been dispensed? What happens if the patient moves and you didn't get the whole injection? That kind of stuff. And the other thing is if we can get a a lot of different dose range, that would be great. If we can get different duration, it's lasting a little bit longer. That would be great. And I love Abilify. The side of profile is pretty reasonable. The medication we like. I just wish they would start getting indications for scheduler affective because sometimes just fighting this battle with insurance company and sometimes for patient assistance, like not having that exact because the fear bipolar diagnosis is just such a hassle the schizoaffective, which is more common diagnosis than schizophrenia. Unfortunately, not a lot of medications approved for that. Okay, if they can get that indication somewhere, that would be great.",2966,3114,388,Fear,Positive,none

Is anything short sampled sometimes is much more sensitive based on the ratios of the anticoagulant to that. So it's going to give flags occasionally. We'll do Smears when we have a Delta change, and that can be related to either the quality of the draw, if the draw was infiltrated by IV or even if it was, God forbid mislabeled and not the correct one, or it could just be, you know, you went to surgery, you lost blood. Now you got a hit and Delta change and we got to look at it. So that's one flag that would cause a Smear review. The second would be any cells that. So we have a panel here based with our medical director that we talk about things that we want to flag. Most of our criteria is really industry standard, but we do have a few that the cancer Ducks really say. Okay, so if I see a different amount of change between the absolute neutrophil out from this day this day, I want it looked at that's predominantly where our flags come from. We also get some flags in there with I'm trying to think of platelet platelet, clumping, low platelets. I would say play. It could be an issue sometimes.",1093,1181,219,Fear,Negative,none

So it's end delivery. So my expectations sometimes are that you've already had these analyzers out there and you've targeted how some of your parameters can help different patient populations. For example, what civic. They were able to show me a lot of papers and usage for Kettering Sloan in New York in their cancer Center and how it helps them. That's very helpful when you have to convince the suite to switch platforms or you've got to convince the Med board that this articulated human Logan really can help you. It's going to make a difference. This is why we need to do that. So peer reviewed or research articles based on why you're giving me what you've given me and that it's solid data and it's reproducible and inconsistent. And then I guess from that point I would talk about usage. So there's two types of usage. One is the computer user, and then there's, like, consumable replacements, reagents anything that you put in and out of the machine. I don't like any instruments that you can't load or unload on the fly or with a very minimal pause time. You can imagine with the amount of CBCS that we put through there pausing for an hour to do any kind of maintenance or any kind of transfer, every agent is going to ruin your flow and you turn around time. So it has to be something that we have a dual modules. So our dual module helps. We can have one down or doing hand entry to a small capillary tube and use the other one. So that's a definite. And then some of the other things that I would love is I like that these things have laser that they look at and they give you the histogram and they give you other data on there. I would love to see more flow cytometry data. I know it's really a far fetched wish list based on the technology and the way it's set up. But the more data that you can give me to the breakdown of different things really helps when you're doing complicating cases for Smear review and you're trying to figure out the ideology or what's really wrong. So that would be helpful.

We negotiated a contract consumables. I know we actually go through a mid vendor for this, which is McKesson not real happy about that, but I guess that's just because of the size of the instruments, then what I do is I put it on the capital list. I get assigned a date that I go to the capital committee. I said in capital and I present my my case and they give me a date when they can cut the check for it.
